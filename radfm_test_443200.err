Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

/home/ab575577/.conda/envs/qwen-radi/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/generation/configuration_utils.py:631: UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`. However, `temperature` is set to `1e-06` -- this flag is only used in sample-based generation modes. You should set `do_sample=True` or unset `temperature`.
